<p style="color:rgb(249, 249, 250);"> Hi there! My name is Prosenjit Chandra Biswas who was born in 2000 in cumilla. I passed HSC examination in 2019 from Birshreshtha Noor Mohammad Public College. I'm studying at CSE since 2020. I have interested in Competitive Programming, Robotics as well as Web Developing. C/C++ Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and Web developing are just a few of the skills I've learned and I also enjoy them.
<br> My fascination with programming and computers began in elementary school when I first encountered computer code, which is utilized to build the website. I was completely enthralled by programming and was inspired to start working on modest projects of my own, usually basic websites. New challenges and problem-solving situations always inspire me to push the boundaries of my knowledge. I would like to play cricket, read books, listen to music, and travel.</p>
